## About the Project 

This project is born to give me (and anyone who wants to contribute to the project) the possibility to learn Solidity (Defi, Ercs standards ...) and Hardhat, anyone can contribute adding by Defi, NFT functionality or improve one that already exists. You can create new tokens, or use existing ones to create new contracts and functions(tested with hardhat is better).

### Guide To Contribute :

- if you want to create token (and you don't want to use the existing ones), call it with a name of a Hawaiian city
- if you want to create functionalities that already exists (and you don't want to improve it) call your new functionalities in this way: "functionalityname_yourname".
- add comment if needed.
- follow the "contributing“ section in the readme.md.

## Convered Concepts until now :
- erc20 
- primitive swap
- buy erc20 tokens with eth 
- erc20 liquidity pool 

## Built With
* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) 
* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) 

## Getting Started with Hardhat 

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat help
```
